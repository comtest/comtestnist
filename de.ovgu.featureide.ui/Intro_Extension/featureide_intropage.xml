				<text>Software product lines (SPL) have a long tradition and will
					gain momentum in the future. Today's research tries to move
					software development to a new quality of industrial production.
					Several solutions concerning different phases of the software
					development process have been proposed in order to cope with
					different problems of program family development. A major problem
					of program family engineering is still the missing tool support.
					The vision is an IDE that brings all phases of the development
					process together, consistently and in a user-friendly manner.
					FeatureIDE is an Eclipse-based IDE that supports all phases of
					feature-oriented software development for the development of SPLs:
					domain analysis, domain implementation, requirements analysis, and
					software generation. Different SPL implementation techniques are
					integrated such as feature-oriented programming (FOP),
					aspect-oriented programming (AOP), delta-oriented programming
					(DOP), and preprocessors. Currently, FeatureIDE provides tool
					support for AHEAD, FeatureC++, FeatureHouse, AspectJ, DeltaJ,
					Antenna and Munge. It also provides a Cheat Sheet Tutorial for your
					first Project. Help-> Cheat Sheets-> FeatureIDE
