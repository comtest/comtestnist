/** 
 * Extends BasicLocker to share locks with another specific locker.
 * <p>In general, a BuddyLocker can be used whenever the primary (API) locker
 * is in use, and we need to lock a node and release that lock before the
 * primary locker transaction ends.  In other words, for this particular lock
 * we don't want to use two-phase locking.  To accomplish that we use a
 * separate BuddyLocker instance to hold the lock, while sharing locks with the
 * primary locker.  The BuddyLocker can be closed to release this particular
 * lock, without releasing the other locks held by the primary locker.</p>
 * <p>In particular, a BuddyLocker is used when acquiring a RANGE_INSERT lock.
 * RANGE_INSERT only needs to be held until the point we have inserted the new
 * node into the BIN.  A separate locker is therefore used so we can release
 * that lock separately when the insertion into the BIN is complete.  But the
 * RANGE_INSERT lock must not conflict with locks held by the primary locker.
 * So a BuddyLocker is used that shares locks with the primary locker.</p>
