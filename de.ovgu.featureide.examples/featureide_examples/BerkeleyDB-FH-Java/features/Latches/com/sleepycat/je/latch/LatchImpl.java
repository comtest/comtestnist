/** 
 * This implementation is used in non-Java5 JVMs.  In Java5 JVMs, the
 * Java5LockWrapperImpl class is used.  The switch hitting is performed in
 * LatchSupport.
 * Simple thread-based non-transactional exclusive non-nestable latch.
 * <p>
 * Latches provide simple exclusive transient locks on objects.  Latches are
 * expected to be held for short, defined periods of time.  No deadlock
 * detection is provided so it is the caller's responsibility to sequence latch
 * acquisition in an ordered fashion to avoid deadlocks.
 * <p>
 * A latch can be acquire in wait or no-wait modes.  In the former, the caller
 * will wait for any conflicting holders to release the latch.  In the latter,
 * if the latch is not available, control returns to the caller immediately.
