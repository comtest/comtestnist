  /** 
 * Lock the environment. Return true if the lock was acquired. If exclusive
 * is false, then this implements a single writer, multiple reader lock. If
 * exclusive is true, then implement an exclusive lock.
 * There is a lock file and there are two regions of the lock file: byte 0,
 * and byte 1. Byte 0 is the exclusive writer process area of the lock file.
 * If an environment is opened for write, then it attempts to take an
 * exclusive write lock on byte 0. Byte 1 is the shared reader process area
 * of the lock file. If an environment is opened for read-only, then it
 * attempts to take a shared lock on byte 1. This is how we implement single
 * writer, multi reader semantics.
 * The cleaner, each time it is invoked, attempts to take an exclusive lock
 * on byte 1. The owning process already either has an exclusive lock on
 * byte 0, or a shared lock on byte 1. This will necessarily conflict with
 * any shared locks on byte 1, even if it's in the same process and there
 * are no other holders of that shared lock. So if there is only one
 * read-only process, it will have byte 1 for shared access, and the cleaner
 * can not run in it because it will attempt to get an exclusive lock on
 * byte 1 (which is already locked for shared access by itself). If a write
 * process comes along and tries to run the cleaner, it will attempt to get
 * an exclusive lock on byte 1. If there are no other reader processes (with
 * shared locks on byte 1), and no other writers (which are running cleaners
 * on with exclusive locks on byte 1), then the cleaner will run.
