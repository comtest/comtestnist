The project is based on an Elevator implementation by Alexander von Rhein:

http://spl2go.cs.ovgu.de/projects/16

Besides transforming aspects into JML, we made the following changes:

* All references to JPF are removed to avoid that JPF is required to compile
  this case study. (Putting these annotations into comments conflicts with the
  current version of the FeatureHouse extension for JML composition.)

* Signature of JUnit_Scenario_Tests.testFinished() changed to
  JUnit_Scenario_Tests.testFinished(Environment env) in order to define a
  contract referencing the environment
  
* Field "Environment env;" introduced in PL_Interface_impl, used in all methods
  Specification1() to Specification14(), removed static keyword from method
  randomSequenceOfActions() and modifiedrandomSequenceOfActions(); all changes
  were made in order to reference the environment in method test()
  
* Field "Environment env;" introduced in Floor and added to constructor as
  parameter; again to access the environment in contracts
  
* Method refinement for method timeshift() added to feature Empty to be able
  refine the contract 

* Method refinement for method pressInLiftFloorButton() added to feature Empty
  to be able refine the contract
  
* New role for class JUnit_Scenario_Tests in feature Empty created for contract
  refinement
  
* New role for class PL_Interface_impl in feature Empty created for contract
  refinement

* Method refinement for method timeshift() added to feature ExecutiveFloor to
  be able refine the contract 

* Method refinement for method continueInDirection() added to feature
  TwoThirdsFull to be able refine the contract
