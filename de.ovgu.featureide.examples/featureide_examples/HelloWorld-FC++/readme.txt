This is a HelloWorld example for FeatureC++ with the MinGW compiler.
To compile install MinGW:

http://sunet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20101030/mingw-get-inst-20101030.exe

Then add C:\MinGW\bin; to the PATH environment variable.

Finally, restart your Eclipse.
