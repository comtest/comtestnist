The project is based on an Email implementation by Alexander von Rhein:

Besides transforming aspects into JML, we made the following changes:

* All references to JPF are removed to avoid that JPF is required to compile
  this case study. (Putting these annotations into comments conflicts with the
  current version of the FeatureHouse extension for JML composition.)

* Method refinement for method Client.mail() added to feature Encrypt
  to be able refine the contract
  
* Method refinement for method Client.incoming() added to feature Encrypt
  to be able refine the contract
  
* Method refinement for method Client.incoming() added to feature Decrypt
  to be able refine the contract
  
* Method refinement for method Client.verify() added to feature Sign
  to be able refine the contract
  
* Method refinement for method Client.mail() added to feature Sign
  to be able refine the contract
  
* Method refinement for method Client.mail() added to feature Verify
  to be able refine the contract
