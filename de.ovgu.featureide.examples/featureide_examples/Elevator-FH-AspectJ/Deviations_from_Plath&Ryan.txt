This implementation of the elevator control system is inspired by the lift system from a publication of Plath and Ryan.

	Feature integration using a feature construct

The specifications and their identifiers were also taken from that publication.
In the publication specifications are assigned to features (the specifications can only be violated when the features are present).

Deviations from that publication:

- We introduced an additional feature "weight" that adds the weight variable to the elevator.
	"TwoThirdsFull" and "overloaded" depend on "weight".

- We moved several specifications from their original features to new features.
	Reason: They are not syntactically dependent on the original features.
	Details:
		Specification 8 moved from "empty" to "base"
		Specification 9 moved from "empty" to "base"
		Specification 10 moved from "overloaded" to "weight"
		Specification 11 moved from "overloaded" to "weight"
		Specification 13 moved from "TwoThirdsFull" to "weight"
	The names of the aspectJ Files remain as they are to reflect the specification's origin.
	The file Scenarios/ScenarioDefinitions.txt is also affected by this change.
